# CII-CIP-Apps
The repository contains source files and documents related to several scenarios for automating the CII CIP opt-in/out process.

1st scenario - CII-CIP-full-automation
--------------------------------------
The objective of this scenario is to limit as much as possible human interventions internal to the organization in charge of the energy distribution network thanks to automation and to transfer any decisions to be taken or operations to be carried out to the user.
The assumption is that it involves a case management solution capable of ensuring the execution of the end-to-end process capable of managing by using models and no-code the exceptions that may arise, ensuring conversational exchanges with the user and articulating with a robotization solution that performs operations on the distribution network by using the head end system console that manages the smart meters.
Alternatively or successively, robotization may be replaced by integration through the interfaces exposed by the HES ensuring better performance.
